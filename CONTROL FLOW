Control Flow
If-else: Decision making.
Loops: for loop AND while loop WORK.

# If-else
num = 10
if num > 5:
    print("Number is greater than 5")
else:
    print("Number is less than or equal to 5")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
counter = 0
while counter < 3:
    print("Counter:", counter)
    counter += 1
